<p>This is my personal website for the year of 2017, inspired by brutalist
design elements. I wanted to create a site that showed off the key projects I
have worked on while showcasing a (jokingly pretentious) personality.</p>
<p>Managing social media presence is one thing, unifying the design language
to show that any media or marketing that I do falls under a clearly
expressed &quot;brand&quot; is another.</p>
<p>It follows these rules</p>
<ol>
<li>If content is king, typography is God</li>
<li>Most of my work is not the site, its just a map.</li>
<li>I want visitors to seek home elsewhere. Getting them to click links is the goal.</li>
</ol>
<p>As the design process goes along, I will be writing down some interesting notes.</p>
<p>Its hard as s**t to get the proper CSS marquee text</p>
<h3 id="design-features-to-be-added">Design Features to be Added</h3>
<ol>
<li>Animated Pretentious Descriptors About Myself</li>
<li>Written SVG Logo said text</li>
<li>Dynamic Navbar that changes after scroll</li>
<li>Contact logos within the navbar (maybe)</li>
<li>Hero Div that takes the max viewport size</li>
<li>Divs Following that that take up the max viewport size</li>
<li>A footer that says &quot;Pushed from my MacBook&quot;</li>
<li>User hostile feel without photos</li>
<li>Content from APIs</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-ngelo-api">The ngelo API</h2>
<p>Once the front-end is completely written, getting a service to aggregate the content
remotely will be the next step.</p>
<h2 id="important-frameworks-and-libraries">Important Frameworks and Libraries</h2>
<p>You know what they say, citations bring you further from hell.</p>
