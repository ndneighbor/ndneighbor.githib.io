        <h2>Vision + execution</h2>
        <p>
        Serving stints in the retail, start-up, and technical world. I learned that it is crucial to always apply
        what you have been learning to every other persuit.</p>
        <p>
        What I saw was the systems used to make one business work can also work for almost any
        field. The logical background I learned from my Computer Science education made a good
        programmer - but humanies and experience makes the software intuitive. </p>
        <p>
        Working in one of the most diverse areas of the United States, I developed a capacity to unite
        people with differing viewpoints to generate inclusive and inspiring product experiences.</p>
        <p>I am always looking for unique opportunities to grow.    See my Software Enginneer resume here.</p>

        <a name="about"></a>
        <h2>Dreamer, fighter, realist.</h2>
        <p>
        Hailing from Kendall, a suburb in Miami - I spent my younger years building computers and
        modding games. A decade and a half without a game console left a young kid who got in
        trouble with tech.</p>
        <p>
        When it was time to get serious in High School, I tried my hand at editing videos, and designing.
        I started doing cross-country and learned how to power through difficult times, such as racing
        a 5K.</p>
        <p>
        I am now at Florida International University, working on opening up research opportunities
        to students.</p>
        <p>
        Just trying to contribute to the play of the world.</p>
