# ngelo.xyz Design Language 2017

This is my personal website for the year of 2017, inspired by brutalist
design elements. I wanted to create a site that showed off the key projects I
have worked on while showcasing a (jokingly pretentious) personality.

Managing social media presence is one thing, unifying the design language
to show that any media or marketing that I do falls under a clearly
expressed "brand" is another.

It follows these rules

1. If content is king, typography is God
2. Most of my work is not the site, its just a map.
3. I want visitors to seek home elsewhere. Getting them to click links is the goal.

As the design process goes along, I will be writing down some interesting notes.

### Design Features

1. Animated Pretentious Descriptors About Myself
2. Written SVG Logo said text
3. Dynamic Navbar that appears after scroll
4. Contact logos within the navbar
5. Hero Div that takes the max viewport size
6. Divs Following that that take up the max viewport size
7. A footer that says "Pushed from my MacBook"
8. User hostile feel without photos


## The ngelo API

Once the front-end is completely written, getting a service to aggregate the content
remotely will be the next step.

## Important Frameworks and Libraries

You know what they say, citations bring you further from hell.
